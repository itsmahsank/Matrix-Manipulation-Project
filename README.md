# Matrix-Manipulation-Project
This C++ project focuses on matrix operations, including functions to compute the sum and product of all matrix elements. It uses nested loops to iterate through matrix rows and columns, performing arithmetic calculations. The program efficiently handles input/output operations and provides basic matrix manipulation functionality
